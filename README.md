# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
Pewlett Hackard is a large company with thousands of employees. Many of these employees are baby boomers and will soon be retiring. Pewlett Hackard is looking to prepare for this mass exit of the work force in two ways. First, for employees who meet a certain criteria they will be offered a retirement package. Second, is an examination of which roles will need to be filled.

Our task here today is to find

- the number of retiring employees per title and
- identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

We will do this by querying various employee databases to find the information we need.


## Results
1. Below is a list of job titles at PH and the number of employees soon to retire.

2. The total number of soon to be retired employees is 72,458.

Many Senior Engineers are set to retire, as well as many Senior Staff. Pewlett Hackard has proposed a mentorship program for qualifying employees to learn from those who are retiring. This should ease the complications of this mass employee exit, and better prepare those who are set to fill these vacant positions. To qualify for this program as proposed, you must be a current employee who was born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965.

3. A breakdown of the number of qualifying employees by job title is shown below.

4. The total number of employees eligible for the mentorship program is 1,549. Of course, because of the enourmous difference between the number of employees retiring, compared with the number of employees eligible for the mentorship program, we are going to have a problem.


## Summary
- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

As per the chart in point one, there are ~72,000 employees that will retire soon.

- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

There are more than enough qualified mentors, but we need more employees to be mentored.

1. Hire young people. According to the data provided, the youngest person employed by PH is 57 years old. Without hiring young people, we are just kicking this problem down the road by a few years. Plus, young people bring new fresh ideas and outside the box thinking. With the right mentorship, this can revolutionize the company.


2. Until we hire some more young people, the only other thing we can do is expand the criteria for who is eligible for the mentorship program. If we open up the criteria to those who were born as far back as 1961 we will have 75,319 eligible employees. This is more than enough to cover the vacant roles. Below is a breakdown of the number of qualifying employees by job title.

As you can see, now there are more than enough qualified employees for the membership program.
